# Silly Mini Games - Knucklebones
This is the frontend of [Silly Mini Game](https://www.sillyminigames.com) written in React. Silly Mini Games is gamehub to play fun, simple and lesser known mini games with your friends! Currently only the game of Knucklebones is available but there is more to come! Knucklebones is insipred by the dice game in the video game Cult of The Lamb.
## Motivation
I built the [Knucklebones backend](https://github.com/AradD7/Go-Knucklebones) but a simple CLI game was not going to be satisying enough, so giving it a UI seemed the only logical step forward! Since a good portion of the app is not related to the logics of a specific game, making the project a gamehub for different games felt like a necessary shift.
