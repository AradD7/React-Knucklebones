        <p>Every dev knows the feeling of coming up with an idea in the middle of night for a project
            and getting all excited and start planning every detail for hours before falling sleep and waking
            up the next day motivated to build something amazing, only to fall into an ancient trap.
            This trap, is of course, the infamous "why stop here?" trap, aka "why think so small" strap, aka
            "why not make millions off of this" trap, you get the point. Why stop with a simple budgeting app,
            why not build a financial tracker and investment planning app that connects to my tv and thermostat
            while automatically tracks my tasks and reminds me through the custom emailing protocol that I will
            definitely make by mysleft completely from from scratch? The desire to turn a simple idea into the
            biggest, most profitable app ever is a great enemy to a lot of developers. Which brings us to this project!
            I initially wanted to put my Go knowledge to use and make a simple Knucklebones game with online play because
            there ain't a good one out there! Naturally, at first I thought I'll make the backend and just have a cli app
            to interact and play. But I wanted my friends and family to be able to play also! I can't get my mom to use the
            command line to roll a dice and place it in a 2x2 matrix! So naturally I had to make a frontend for it, which is
            why I spent weeks to learn React and made this website. But wait, why stop at one simple dice game where I can
            make an entire roster of games built with mostly the same backend? Which finally brings us to Silly Mini Games!
            Silly Mini Game is a gamehub with lesser known, fun and engaging 2 player games that all use the same backend
            for connecting, authenticating and account management. At this moment only Knucklebones is available but I
            will be adding other games in the future (wink wink).
            But no fr I will actually add other games. For now, enjoy Knucklebones! Message me with an invite link even!
            Lastly checkout my github page and thank you for taking the time and intrest in my project.
